# LibreCube Board Template

This repository contains the templates of the PC/104-alike LibreCube board.
The electrical template was made with [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/), whereas the mechanical template was made with [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/).

You may use the templates to develop boards for the [LibreCube open source ecosystem](https://librecube.gitlab.io/).

You may also use the templates to develop your own, commercial or non-commerical, boards. In such case however, you **MUST** remove any LibreCube logo from your board.
